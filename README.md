### About me ðŸ‘‹

I am a motivated and determined software developer who has recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). Prior to Makers I worked as an editor for six years across a range of subject areas where I honed my attention to detail, ability work to a deadline and manage complex projects. I decided to make the change into tech as there is always something to learn and I enjoy challenging myself.

I have experience working with the programming languages Ruby, JavaScript, Python and C. I have familiar with the fundamentals of software development including object-oriented languages, test-driven development, full stack development and GitHub. I have also completed edXâ€™s CS50â€™s introduction to computer science.

<summary>Skills</summary>

#### Communication
Developed during my years as an editor where communication skills were paramount. Ability to understand and communicate complex technical information, with the result that I was able to edit two 30 000 word books and write articles on IT service management and project management. This translated into an ability to write clear documentation for the final project at Makers. Also demonstrated team working skills when I ran editorial meetings with editorial board to discuss and plan upcoming issues of a monthly trade magazine.

#### Problem-solving
Needed to ensure that content met user needs at AXELOS. Consequently, started and chaired the new ideas meeting, whereby colleagues shared user feedback, which was then translated into actionable ideas. Researched the market using available resources to understand user needs. This included attending conferences, researching competitorsâ€™ content and speaking with external stakeholders and developed products to meet those needs. These skills were useful when planning projects at Makers, where each project had to meet the users' requirements.

#### Determination
Decided to learn software development by starting with CS50â€™s introduction to computer science in August 2022. Prior experience focused on content management systems, designing content with Adobe InDesign and the non-technical aspects of developing a website, including adding landing pages and content. Despite the steep learning curve, I consistently developed skills using online resources and books, such as Code by Charles Petzold. As a result, I was able to complete Makers Academy.

#### Delivery
At Axelos simultaneously managed several products and published at least four pieces of content a month exceeding targets. Effectively implemented version control during each projects development phase to avoid delays and ensure that the correct version of the final product was delivered. During Makers I was able to use a Kanban board to chart the teams progress and GitHub to ensure that the correct version of the program was in the main branch.
